    <h4>
        Baby you shine, just like the stars in the sky.
        The wizard of Oz. Using his magical pause.
        He can stop time so that I can appreciate 
        your beauty even just for a little while.
    </h4>

    <h4>
       Like the unrelenting waves, crashing ashore.
       My feelings for you overflows more and more.
    </h4>

    <h4>
        Very lucky, that I am. For I found your love,
        As rare as a blue whale, As deep as the sea.
        A miracle that happens, Once in a lifetime.
        I took the shot and it landed me right beside you
     </h4>

     <h4>
        Just like the blue sky, You clear my mind.
        Because the only thing that passes through my mind,
        Is to keep loving you till the end of time.
     </h4>

     <h4>
        THE SUN IS INSIDE ME
        MY EMOTIONS BURN HOLES IN MY SKIN
        THE LIGHT PEEKS THRU
