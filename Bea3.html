        <h4>
            Like the white snow my love for you is pure.
            The only intention is to make you happy,
            that I assure. As it falls from the sky, a 
            great calmness it ensues. Exactly like the
            calmness I feel when I'm with you
        </h4>

        <h4>
            Oh my sweet love I really don't get it,
            a lot of problems has arrived, that's pretty
            apparent.
            Through the difficulties and hardships 
            we begin to stride.
            
            I believe that we'll make this work,
            especially when we have each other.
            Because you melt all my worries away
            when we are together.
