        <h4>
            You are my moon in the sky.
            Guiding me throughout the night.
            
            An angel descendant that's what you are.
            You are my wish, my shooting star.
            
            As time goes by, I want you to see.
            I'll love you forever till eternity.
        </h4>

        <h4>
            Through the highs and lows.
            Our love it grows.
            
            As soft as the sunlight.
            In the morning not too bright.
            
            It brings peace and warmth.
            To my breathing heart.
        </h4>

        <h4>
            At the beginning of the day and at the end of night.
            My thoughts they race, they have you in mind.
            
            Oh how wonderful each day each moment that goes by.
            Because I'm assured when you're by my side.
            
            Oh wee oh woe the child in me has awoke.
            It shows up once again to spread love and make you broke.
            
            You are the love of my life, wanna know how?
            Because I love you in my past and in my future, especially now.
