        <h4>
            My love, I have something to confess.
            My life was miserable until I conffesed,
            to you and I'm glad my feelings came 
            through. I had a doubt you wouldn't 
            feel the same. Yet I still yearned for your 
            heart, am I to blame?
        </h4>

        <h4>
            You are beautiful, warm and an affectionate
            person. What more could you want? You have
            everything and then some. My dear let me make
            something clear, I'm not with you because I'm 
            scared. I'm with you because I care.
