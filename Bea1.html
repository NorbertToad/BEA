        <h4>
            From the very start I have had my eyes.
            On you alone you made me smile. Through
            your eyes I saw a future, full of delight and
            an incredible wife with starry skies and cats 
            for life.
        </h4>

        <h4>
            From that day on I decided to push,
            to love you til my legs gave out and 
            even then I'd crawl to your side to 
            hold you tight.
